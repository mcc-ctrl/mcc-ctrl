<body>
    <p>I worked in Casino Surveillance for 10 years in the UK and Australia. Early on in my Security career I had always
        dreamed of setting up a physical pentesting consultancy for Casinos. Finding out that Penetration testing was a
        role in cyber security peaked my interest. The government in Australia are currently offering free tafe courses
        for Cert IV in Cyber Security, Iâ€™m currently studying this 18 month part time course with Victoria University.
        This is currently absorbing my Tuesday and Thursday evenings between 17:30-19:30. Iâ€™m really enjoying the course
        and is helping anchor the foundational knowledge required. I am looking to compliment this with a Pentesting
        certificate such as CPTS, eJPT, CEH, OSCP. I am a permanent resident based in Melbourne and I am currently
        applying for Australian Citizenship. Join me on my journey to become a Pentester, feel free to reach out and
        share your thoughts or just have a chat.</p>

    <p>Other than cyber security I enjoy spending time with my two beautiful daughters and playing/watching Basketball.
        I enjoy my Coffee a little too much and love the odd Imperial Pastry Stout ðŸ˜Š Cheers</p>
